Contact
=======
Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/libass/libass/issues?state=open) to report bugs or feature requests.

We have an IRC channel, too. Talk to us on [irc.libera.chat/#libass](https://web.libera.chat/#libass). Note that we cannot be online all the time and we cannot answer IRC questions if you leave the channel. Even if you do not get an immediate response, keep your IRC client open, and we will eventually get back to you.

Building
========

libass offers two build systems to choose from: Autotools and Meson.

Autotools is preferred for development since it integrates with our testing
infrastructure and is feature-complete on all platforms supported by Autotools.  
If you are packaging libass for distribution, Autotools is recommended;
when packaging for Windows Meson should work equally well.

Meson lacks integration with testing infrastructure, but works otherwise well on
Windows. It is suited for static-only builds on any platform well supported by
Meson and as a Meson subproject.
Notably, Meson supports MSVC and generation of VS project files.

Macro defines
-------------

Unless developing libass thereâ€™s usually no need to manually define macros
and there are no stability guarantees for these manual defines.

- `DEBUG_LEVEL=0..3`
  - `0` use the default set of asserts; implied if macro is not defined at all
  - `1` enable additional asserts that may mildly impact performance
  - `2` enable additional asserts that may seriously impact performance
  - `3` additionally assert assumptions usually pledged to the compiler for optimization purposes
