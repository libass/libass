libass (0.17.1)
 * Fix buffer overread if soft-wrapping occurred and
   ASS_FEATURE_WHOLE_TEXT_LAYOUT was enabled via API or due to Encoding -1
   (bug introduced in 0.16.0)
 * x86: detect GNU Hurd and configure NASM appropriately

libass (0.17.0)

 * Improve quality of SSA Effects movement
 * Further documentation improvements
 * Completely invalid Events are now discarded during parsing

 * Introduction of LayoutRes{X,Y} script headers
 * New AlphaLevel style override to set all alpha values while keeping the color
 * Add ASS_FEATURE_WRAP_UNICODE to allow automatic linebreaks in accordance
   with the Unicode line breaking algorithm instead of ASS' much stricter
   breaking rules. For the feature to be available at runtime, libass must be
   linked against the new optional dependency libunibreak.

 * Improve VSFilter compatibility:
   * Fix premature truncation of animated alphas (was a 0.15.0 regression)
   * Fix handling of small delay parameters for legacy SSA Effects

 * x86: Fix potential buffer over-read by 16 bytes with AVX2 assembly
     when large tiles are not enabled (the default)
 * x86: Fix PIC flags not being interpreted by the assembler, breaking the
     asm-enabled build setup on NetBSD and OpenBSD. On 32-bit x86, if the toolchain
     requires PIC objects and relies on compiler defaults to get PIC implicitly,
     you need to pass `--with-pic` to configure to ensure NASM always produces
     PIC objects
 * x86: Fix AVX support not being detected on non-Intel CPUs and some VMs
 * x86: Fix CPUID being used on CPUs not supporting the instruction (<= i486)
     and the way it is used for CPUs with less than 7 CPUID-leafs
     which could lead to crashes due to illegal instructions
 * MS Windows-only issue: Fix crashes with FreeType >= 2.11.1 on Win32
     when rendering strikethrough or underline

 * Improve `\iclip` quality
 * Improve quality of very small outlines

 * Expand documentation and fix mistakes in it
 * configure now errors out if an explicitly requested feature is unavailable
 * MS Windows-only issue: ease linking against static/shared GNU FriBidi

     to the entire unsplit event text. The non-portable `Encoding=-1` mode
     always behaves as if the feature were enabled
 * MS Windows-only issue: add support for arbitrary Unicode paths;
     see documentation of related functions for details

 * Improve VSFilter compatibility
    * Do not treat format lines using `Actor` in place of `Name`

    * Match VSFilter's \fsp effects on bidi and shaping
    * Match VSFilter's \fay behaviour
    * Support non-Unicode font cmaps when Win32 API or iconv
      is available and can convert to the relevant encoding
    * Treat empty clip outlines as if everything was outside the clip
      not inside (was a 0.14.0 regression)
    * Parse integer parameters of override tags more like VSFilter

libass (0.15.2)

 * Fix output of ASM-enabled builds deviating from non-ASM builds

 * Fix backwards/VSFilter-incompatible font sizes with FreeType 2.10+
 * Improve speed via better caching
 * Require HarfBuzz unconditionally to ensure good shaping for complex scripts
 * ass_set_use_margins(true) now simply places text on the whole

   margins are used to implement pan & scan in a video player
 * Add ass_track_set_feature() & catch-all ASS_FEATURE_INCOMPATIBLE_EXTENSIONS
 * Add ASS_FEATURE_BIDI_BRACKETS to enable Unicode 6.3+ bracket matching
   when applying the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm
   (incompatible with VSFilter; requires libass built with FriBidi 1.0+)
 * Fix stack overflow on deeply nested \t tags
 * Fix positioning of events with leading line breaks
 * Fix small but nonzero \bord becoming \bord0 (regression in 0.14.0)

 * Switch from Yasm to NASM for building hand-written assembler code
 * Support Core Text font provider on Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7

   font choices and an occasional crash if this function is called midway
   through rendering a file.

libass (0.13.7)
 * Fix invalid memory accesses with BorderStyle=4

     result in illegal reads while laying out and shaping text.
     (CVE-2016-7969)

libass (0.13.3)
 * Improve compatibility/portablility of build system,
   should fix e.g. compilation on Solaris.

 * Add ass_set_check_readorder() API function to disable use of the ReadOrder
   field for duplicate checking in ass_process_chunk().

   * Fix an issue with the new duplicate checking, which could lead to
     missing subtitles after seeking.
   * Fix a crash with CoreText under specific circumstances

libass (0.13.1)
 * Much faster duplicate event check in ass_process_chunk. This can
   bring a large speedup for embedded subtitles with lots of events.
   To make this possible, it is now forbidden to combine calls to
   ass_process_chunk with any other method of manipulating the event
   list, namely, manual manipulation and calls to ass_process_data,
   ass_read_memory and ass_read_file.
 * Interpret negative timestamp components as actual negative numbers.
   This change increases compatibility with VSFilter.
 * Font matching changes for VSFilter compatibility
   * Look up fonts that contain PostScript outlines by their PostScript
     name instead of their full names. Family names continue to be used
     for all fonts.

 * Drop support for Fontconfig < 2.10.92 to ensure correct font matching
 * Bug fixes
   * Fix building the assembler code for the x32 ABI (GH #200)
   * Fix static linking against libass through pkg-config when libass
     uses libiconv
   * Fix some small memory leaks, potential crashes and bad data uses

libass (0.13.0)
 * Add native font selection backends for OSX (CoreText) and Windows
   (DirectWrite). You can now run libass without fontconfig on these
   platforms. This fixes problems with fontconfig behaving badly on
   these platforms (it could take minutes to scan all system fonts).
   Even on Linux, this speeds up loading of embedded fonts (such as
   provided by ass_add_font()).
   The DirectWrite backend only works on Windows Vista and later. On
   XP, fontconfig is still needed. libass can be compiled with both
   DirectWrite and fontconfig, and then it will fallback to fontconfig
   automatically if DirectWrite is not available at runtime.
 * Add ass_get_available_font_providers() API function.
 * Change the 4th parameter of ass_set_fonts(). This now selects the
   font provider. This is somewhat backwards compatible with the old
   behavior, but if you ever passed values other than 0 or 1, your
   application might break with this libass release.
 * The ass_fonts_update() function now does nothing. It's kept for
   backward compatibility only.
 * Much faster gaussian blur. This can bring a large speedup with big
   blurred signs and such.
 * Drop ENCA support
 * Bug fixes
   * Fix compilation of the freetype rasterizer (disabled by default)
   * Fix rendering with some cases of consecutive line breaks (\N\N).

   This change increases compatibility with VSFilter.
