/**
 * GENERAL NOTE regarding the definitions exposed by this header
 *
 * The main use case for this is _reading_ the track fields, especially
 * track->YCbCrMatrix, to correctly display the rendering results.
 *
 * Furthermore, the exposed definitions also open up the possibility to _modify_
 * the exposed structs, working closer to library internals and bypassing
 * e.g. creation of intermediate ASS-text buffers when creating dynamic events.
 * This is an advanced use case and should only be done when well-versed in ASS
 * and aware of the effects and legal values of _all_ fields of the structs.
 * The burden of sanitising and correctly initialising fields is then also
 * placed on the API user.
 * By nature of direct struct modifications working closer to library internals,
 * workflows that make use of this possibility are also more likely to be
 * affected by future API breaks than those which do not.
 *
 * To avoid desynchronisation with internal states, there are some restrictions
 * on when and how direct struct modification can be performed.
 * Ignoring them may lead to undefined behaviour. See the following listing:
 *
 *  - Manual struct edits and track-modifying (including modification to the
 *    event and style elements of the track) API calls cannot be freely mixed:
 *    - Before manual changes are performed, it is allowed to call any such API,
 *      unless the documentation of the funtion says otherwise.
 *    - After manual changes have been performed, no track-modifying API may be
 *      invoked, except for ass_track_set_feature and ass_flush_events.
 *  - After the first call to ass_render_frame, existing array members
 *    (e.g. members of events) and non-array track fields (e.g. PlayResX
 *    or event_format) must not be modified. Adding new members to arrays
 *    and updating the corresponding counter remains allowed.
 *  - Adding and removing members to array fields, like events or styles,
 *    must be done through the corresponding API function, e.g. ass_alloc_event.
 *    See the documentation of these functions.
 *  - The memory pointed to by string fields (char *) must be
 *    free'able by the implementation of free used by libass.
 *
 * A non-exhaustive list of examples of track-modifying API functions:
 *   ass_process_data, ass_process_codec_private,
 *   ass_process_chunk, ass_read_styles, ...
 *
 * Direct struct modification can be done safely, but it is also easy to
 * miss an initialisation or violate these restrictions, thus introducing bugs
 * that may not manifest immediately. It should be carefully considered
 * whether this is worthwhile for the desired use-case.

/**
 * Support for (xy-)VSFilter mangled colors
 *
 * Generally, xy-VSFilter emulates the classic VSFilter behavior of
 * rendering directly into the (usually YCbCr) video. Classic
 * guliverkli(2)-VSFilter is hardcoded to use BT.601(TV) as target colorspace
 * when converting the subtitle RGB color to the video colorspace.
 * This led to odd results when other colorspaces were used, particular
 * once those became more common with the rise of HDTV video:
 * HDTV typically uses BT.709(TV), but VSFilter continued assuming
 * BT.601(TV) for conversion.
 *
 * This means classic vsfilter will mangle colors as follows:
 *
 *    screen_rgb = video_csp_to_rgb(rgb_to_bt601tv(ass_rgb))
 *
 * where video_csp is the colorspace of the video with which the
 * subtitle was muxed.
 *
 * Subtitle authors worked around this issue by adjusting the color
 * to look as intended *after* going through the mangling process. Still,
 * this behaviour isn't great and also limits the color range. Yet,
 * for backwards compatibility with existing files, the classic mangling
 * must be preserved for existing files to not break the display of
 * color-matched typesets created with older VSFilter versions. Thus,
 * on iniative of xy-VSFilter/XYSubFilter a new explicit "YCbCr Matrix"
 * header was introduced to allow new files to avoid this color mangling.
 * However due to a limitation of VSFilter API, VSFilters don't actually
 * know the real colorspace of the video they're rendering to, so the
 * header wasn't created as a simple "Use ColourMangling: yes/no", but instead
 * specifies exactly which colorspace to use for the initial conversion
 * from the subtitle's RGB values to the video's YCbCr. So we now got
 *
 *    screen_rgb = video_csp_to_rgb(rgb_to_ycbcr_header_csp(ass_rgb))
 *
 * with rgb_to_ycbcr_header_csp defaulting to TV-range BT.601.
 *
 * XySubFilter, whose API was planned during introduction of this header,
 * is not affected by this VSFilter-API limitation, so for it and other
 * renderers like libass an additional special value "None" was also added.
 * "None" tells the renderer to directly use untouched RGB values without
 * any conversion.
 *
 * If the video itself is already in RGB natively, then no color mangling
 * happens regardless of the presence or value of a "YCbCr Matrix" header.
 *
 * The above mangling process with special value "None" to opt out
 * of any color mangling is the recommended default behaviour.
 *
 * Keep in mind though, that xy-VSFilter cannot accurately implement this and
 * will instead resort to a guessing the video colorspace based on resolution
 * and then convert RGB to the guessed space.
 * Also some versions of MPC-HC's Internal Subtitle Renderer don't implement
 * "None" and use TV.601 for unknown, but the video colorspace for no or an
 * empty header (which can break old subtitles).
 *
 * Aegisub's (the main application to produce ASS subtitle scripts) behaviour
 * regarding colorspaces is unfortunately a bit confusing.
 * As of time of writing there still is a config option to force BT.601(TV)
 * in some active forks (which should not be used to author subs and serves
 * at most as a tool to check how now ancient VSFilters would have rendered the
 * subs), the automatically chosen colorspace may depend on the fork and the
 * videoprovider used and furthermore Aegisub likes to override
 * "YCbCr Matrix: None" with the autodetected space of a loaded video.
 * Supposedly some Aegisub versions had an option that "tries not to mangle the
 * colors". It was said that if the header is not set to BT.601(TV), the colors
 * were supposed not to be mangled, even if the header was not set to "None".
 *
 * In general, misinterpreting this header or not using it will lead to
 * slightly different subtitle colors, which can matter if the subtitle
 * attempts to match solid colored areas in the video.
 * It is recommended to stick to XySubFilter-like behaviour described above.
 * A highly motivated application may also expose options to users to  emulate
 * xy-VSFilter's resolution-depended guess or other (historic) mangling modes.
 * Completly ignoring the color mangling is likely to give bad results.
 *
 * Note that libass doesn't change colors based on this header. It
 * absolutely can't do that, because the video colorspace is required
 * in order to handle this as intended. API users must use the exposed
 * information to perform color mangling as described above.
